Split epics.md into individual epic files:\n   - docs/epics/epic-1-multiplayer-foundation.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-2-core-combat.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-3-weapon-systems.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-4-networked-gameplay.md\n   - (continue for epics 5-9)\n\n2.

This slows down development feedback loops and CI pipelines.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nTests use `time.Sleep` with actual game timing constants instead of mocked/injectable time:\n\n### Major time sinks identified:\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:216`: `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` - health regen delay\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:296`: `time.Sleep(5500 * time.Millisecond)` - health regen after respawn  \n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:277`: `time.Sleep(3500 * time.Millisecond)` - respawn timing\n- `player_test.go:873`: `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)` - respawn delay\n- `gameserver_shooting_test.go`: Two 1700ms sleeps for reload cooldowns\n- 50+ smaller sleeps (50-100ms each) for async operations\n\n### Slow test breakdown:\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegenerationAfterRespawn`: 9.00s\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegeneration`: 6.10s\n- `TestGameServerRespawn_WeaponStateReset`: 3.10s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback_NoCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerPhysicsIntegration`: 1.00s\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n1. **Inject a clock interface** - Create a `Clock` interface with `Now()` and `Sleep()` methods. Use real clock in production, fake clock in tests that can be advanced instantly.\n\n2. **Use test-specific timing constants** - Allow tests to override `RespawnDelay`, `HealthRegenDelay`, `ReloadTime` etc. with shorter values.\n\n3. **Replace sleeps with event channels** - Instead of sleeping arbitrary durations, wait for specific events/conditions to occur.\n\n4. **Tag slow tests for optional exclusion** - Use `//go:build slow` build tags so developers can skip slow tests during rapid iteration.\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nReduce server test runtime from ~33s to \u003c5s while maintaining test coverage and reliability.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/game/gameserver.go` - Add clock injection\n- `internal/game/player.go` - Add clock injection for respawn/regen timing\n- `internal/game/weapon.go` - Add clock injection for reload timing\n- All test files using `time.Sleep`","notes":"Pull Request: https://github.com/mtomcal/stick-rumble/pull/10","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:58:09.556838989Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","close_reason":"PR #10 merged.
