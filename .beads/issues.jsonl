Track if pointer is held down\n2. In update loop, check if pointer is held and weapon is automatic\n3. Continuously call shoot() while held (respecting fire rate cooldown)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Holding mouse button fires Uzi continuously at 6 rounds/sec\n- [ ] Holding mouse button fires AK47 continuously at 5 rounds/sec\n- [ ] Pistol still requires individual clicks (semi-automatic)\n- [ ] Shotgun still requires individual clicks (pump action)\n- [ ] Fire rate cooldown still enforced (no faster than weapon allows)\n- [ ] Tests verify automatic fire behavior\n\n## Technical Notes\nFiles to modify:\n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/scenes/GameScene.ts` - add pointerup tracking and update loop logic\n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/input/ShootingManager.ts` - add isAutomatic check based on weapon type\n\nWeapon fire rates (from server):\n- Uzi: 6.0 rounds/sec\n- AK47: 5.0 rounds/sec  \n- Pistol: 3.0 rounds/sec (semi-auto)\n- Shotgun: 1.0 rounds/sec (pump)","notes":"TEST REVIEW PASS 2 COMPLETE - NO ISSUES FOUND.

{"id":"stick-rumble-3m9","title":"Melee weapons show 0/0 ammo and RELOAD indicator - weapons broken","description":"## Summary\nWhen picking up melee weapons (Bat or Katana), the UI incorrectly shows:\n- Ammo display: 0/0 (should be hidden or show infinite for melee)\n- RELOAD! indicator flashes (melee weapons don't reload)\n- Melee attacks do not work at all\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\nLooking at the code:\n1. `ShootingManager.ts` handles both ranged and melee weapons\n2. When weapon state updates (`weapon:state` message), it sets `currentAmmo` and `maxAmmo`\n3. For melee weapons, server sends `magazineSize: 0` (see `weapon.go:96`: `CurrentAmmo: weapon.MagazineSize`)\n4. `GameSceneUI.updateAmmoDisplay()` shows RELOAD! when `isEmpty()` returns true (ammo \u003c= 0)\n\nThe client needs to:\n1. Hide ammo display for melee weapons\n2. Not show RELOAD indicator for melee\n3. Call `meleeAttack()` instead of `shoot()` for melee weapons on click\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Picking up Bat or Katana hides the ammo counter\n- [ ] No RELOAD indicator shown for melee weapons  \n- [ ] Click triggers melee attack for melee weapons (not ranged shoot)\n- [ ] Melee attacks register hits on server\n- [ ] Tests cover melee weapon UI behavior\n\n## Technical Notes\nFiles to modify:\n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/scenes/GameSceneUI.ts` - hide ammo for melee\n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/scenes/GameScene.ts` - call meleeAttack() for melee  \n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/input/ShootingManager.ts` - track weapon type for attack routing\n- `stick-rumble-client/src/game/scenes/GameSceneEventHandlers.ts` - update weapon type tracking","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-14T08:32:40.76822-07:00","created_by":"Michael A Tomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-14T15:50:52.090771098Z","labels":["combat","melee","ui"]}

{"id":"stick-rumble-48z","title":"Part 2: Playwright Visual Tests for Game Entities + CI Integration","description":"## Summary\nThis is Part 2 of the comprehensive test harness (stick-rumble-q26 was Part 1). Part 1 added enhanced Phaser mocks and scene lifecycle unit tests. Part 2 adds Playwright visual tests that run in the actual browser to catch rendering bugs that unit tests cannot detect.\n\n## Why This Matters\nEven with excellent unit test coverage (90%+), bugs like player sprite duplication (AT3) and melee animation not rendering (o5y) slip through because:\n1. Unit tests verify method calls, not actual pixels on screen\n2. Unit tests use mocks, not real Phaser rendering\n3. Visual bugs only manifest in the actual browser\n\n## Relationship to AT3 (Player Sprite Duplication Bug)\nThe AT3 bug is a perfect example of what Part 2 will catch:\n- PR #39 claimed to fix sprite duplication but it still occurs\n- Unit tests pass but browser shows duplicate sprites\n- A Playwright visual test for `restartScene()` would catch this immediately\n- The test harness will expose `getActiveSprites()` to verify sprite count = player count\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Phase 1: Test Harness HTML Page\n- [ ] Create `/public/ui-test-entities.html` following the existing `/ui-test.html` pattern\n- [ ] Create `src/entity-test-scene.ts` for isolated entity testing\n- [ ] Expose window functions:\n  - `window.spawnPlayer(id, x, y, color)` - Create a player sprite\n  - `window.removePlayer(id)` - Remove a player sprite\n  - `window.getPlayerCount()` - Return count of active player sprites\n  - `window.getActiveSprites()` - Return array of all active sprites\n  - `window.triggerMeleeSwing(weaponType, angle)` - Trigger melee animation\n  - `window.restartScene()` - Restart the scene (simulates match restart)\n  - `window.clearAllSprites()` - Clean slate for tests\n- [ ] Initialize with dark background for visual contrast in screenshots\n\n### Phase 2: Playwright Visual Tests\n- [ ] Create `tests/visual/player-sprites.spec.ts`:\n  - Test single player spawn renders correctly\n  - Test multiple players spawn without overlap\n  - Test player removal cleans up sprite completely\n  - **CRITICAL**: Test scene restart does NOT duplicate sprites (catches AT3 bug)\n  - Test `getActiveSprites().length === expected` after each operation\n- [ ] Create `tests/visual/melee-animation.spec.ts`:\n  - Test Bat swing shows brown arc (0x8B4513)\n  - Test Katana swing shows silver arc (0xC0C0C0)\n  - Test arc is visible during animation\n  - Test arc is NOT visible after animation completes\n- [ ] Create `tests/visual/scene-lifecycle.spec.ts`:\n  - Test fresh scene has zero sprites\n  - Test spawn/remove cycle leaves zero sprites\n  - Test multiple restarts do not accumulate zombie sprites\n\n### Phase 3: CI Integration\n- [ ] Update `vitest.config.ts` to NOT exclude visual tests from main test run\n- [ ] Add Playwright visual test step to CI workflow\n- [ ] Configure screenshot diff reporting on test failure\n- [ ] Failed visual tests should block PR merge\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Existing Pattern to Follow\n```typescript\n// tests/visual/health-bar.spec.ts -

Poor Test File Naming - coverage_boost_test.go, final_coverage_boost_test.go, simple_broadcast_coverage_test.go suggest tests written to chase coverage numbers rather than verify behavior.\n\n2. Overuse of assert.NotPanics() Without Behavior Verification - Tests execute code paths but don't verify correct behavior. Functions could fail silently and tests would pass. Examples: final_coverage_boost_test.go lines 21-35, 50-76, 84-99, 244-248.\n\n3. Integration Tests Don't Verify Message Receipt - connected_clients_test.go creates WebSocket connections, sends messages, but never reads from connections to verify messages arrive. Defeats purpose of integration tests.\n\n4. Significant Test Duplication - broadcastWeaponPickup tested in 4 files, sendShootFailed in 4 files, onHit in 3 files. Inflates coverage without adding test value.\n\n5. Tests Loop Without Meaningful Assertions - simple_broadcast_coverage_test.go lines 145-150 calls sendWeaponState 5 times with only NotPanics assertions.\n\n6. Heavy Reliance on time.Sleep() for Synchronization - Could lead to flaky tests based on system load.\n\n7. Weak Assertions for Test Intent - TestOnHit_DeathCodePaths only checks kills \u003e= 0, doesn't verify death was processed.\n\n8. Inconsistent WebSocket Verification - Some tests verify message receipt (coverage_boost_test.go), others don't (connected_clients_test.go).\n\nRecommendation:\nThese issues are NON-BLOCKING for acceptance criteria (\u003e90% coverage, tests pass, no lint/type errors).

The changes made were:\n- Changed from page.locator('canvas').toHaveScreenshot() to page.toHaveScreenshot()\n- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors related to 'clip' property\n\nASSERTION PATTERN REVIEW:\nThe tests use await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('filename.png', { clip: {...} })\n\nThis is the CORRECT pattern for Playwright visual regression testing. The assertion:\n1. Takes a screenshot of the specified region\n2. Compares it to a baseline image\n3.

They are visual regression tests where the assertion IS the screenshot comparison itself. This is the expected pattern.\n\nPOTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:\n1. Tests use page.waitForTimeout(100) - hardcoded waits are brittle\n2. No verification that window.setHealthBarState() or window.addKillFeedEntry() functions exist\n3.

{"id":"stick-rumble-6s2","title":"Leaderboard shows 0 kills/deaths: GetFinalScores uses wrong data source","description":"## Problem\nMatch end leaderboard shows 0 kills and 0 deaths for all players even when players got kills during the match. This is a regression or incomplete fix from stick-rumble-ife.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n`GetFinalScores()` in `match.go:186-213` has a data source mismatch:\n\n```go\nfor playerID := range m.PlayerKills {      // Uses Match.PlayerKills for iteration\n    player, exists := world.players[playerID]\n    score := PlayerScore{\n        Kills:  player.Kills,               // But reads from PlayerState.Kills\n        Deaths: player.Deaths,              // And PlayerState.Deaths  \n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere are TWO separate kill tracking systems:\n1. `Match.PlayerKills` - incremented by `room.Match.AddKill()` in message_processor.go:233\n2. `PlayerState.Kills` - incremented by `attackerState.IncrementKills()` in message_processor.go:171\n\nThe code iterates over players who have Match kills, but reads the kill count from PlayerState - these can get out of sync if:\n- PlayerState is reset on respawn/reconnect\n- World players are cleared before GetFinalScores is called\n- Race condition between the two tracking systems\n\n## Evidence\n- Screenshot shows both players with 0 kills, 0 deaths\n- XP breakdown shows 'Kills (0 × 100): 0'\n- Server logs show match ended but no kill events visible\n\n## Fix Options\n\n### Option A: Use Match.PlayerKills directly (preferred)\n```go\nscore := PlayerScore{\n    Kills:  m.PlayerKills[playerID],  // Use match's kill tracking\n    Deaths: m.PlayerDeaths[playerID], // Need to add death tracking to Match\n}\n```\n\n### Option B: Remove duplicate tracking\nOnly use PlayerState for kills/deaths, iterate over world.players instead of m.PlayerKills\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Kills display correctly in match end leaderboard\n- [ ] Deaths display correctly in match end leaderboard\n- [ ] XP calculation uses correct kill count\n- [ ] Add logging to verify data flow during match end\n- [ ] Integration test that verifies kills persist through match lifecycle\n\n## Related Issues\n- stick-rumble-ife: Original schema fix (closed but incomplete)\n- stick-rumble-wzq: Testing improvements to catch config sync issues - **similar pattern of dual data sources**\n\n## Testing Improvements Needed\nThis is the SAME bug pattern as stick-rumble-wzq (weapon-configs.json vs hardcoded fallback):\n1. **Dual source of truth** - two places tracking the same data\n2. **No integration test** verifying end-to-end data flow\n3. **Unit tests pass** but don't test the integration point\n\nRecommended tests:\n1. E2E test: Player kills → match end → leaderboard shows correct kills\n2. Integration test: Verify Match.PlayerKills == PlayerState.Kills after kill\n3.

Tests need to wait for the async broadcast to complete before reading from the WebSocket.\n\nNEXT APPROACH:\nThese failing tests expose a fundamental design issue: calling handler methods directly creates race conditions. Since this is a TEST QUALITY review (not production code fixes), the correct approach is:\n1. Document that these tests expose production race conditions\n2. Keep test assertions as-is (they correctly validate expected behavior)\n3. Note that production code needs synchronization fixes\n4.

By making it lazy, schemas now load only when first accessed, and the singleton pattern ensures they load exactly once.\n\nStatus: Ready for review and merge","created_at":"2026-01-12T15:23:59Z"},{"id":22,"issue_id":"stick-rumble-g4i","author":"mtomcal","text":"=== FINAL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY ===\n\n**Problem**: Intermittent test failures due to race condition in schema loading when tests run in parallel.\n\n**Root Cause**: \n- globalHandler was eagerly initialized at package init time (line 97)\n- This triggered immediate schema loading before TestMain could reset singletons\n- Multiple test runs caused schema loading contention and log spam\n\n**Solution Implemented**:\n\n1. **Lazy Global Handler Initialization** (websocket_handler.go)\n   - Converted globalHandler from eager to lazy initialization\n   - Added getGlobalHandler() with sync.Once pattern\n   - Added resetGlobalHandler() for test isolation\n   - Updated StartGlobalHandler/StopGlobalHandler to use lazy getter\n\n2. **Test Setup Infrastructure** (test_main_test.go - NEW FILE)\n   - Added TestMain to reset all singletons before tests\n   - Ensures clean state for every test run\n   - Prevents cross-test contamination\n\n3. **Comprehensive Testing** (global_handler_test.go - NEW FILE)\n   - TestGlobalHandlerLazyInitialization - Verifies singleton behavior\n   - TestGlobalHandlerConcurrentAccess - Tests 20 concurrent goroutines\n   - TestResetGlobalHandler - Validates reset functionality\n   - TestGlobalHandlerSchemaLoadersInitialized - Checks schema loading\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- stick-rumble-server/internal/network/websocket_handler.go (lazy init)\n- stick-rumble-server/internal/network/test_main_test.go (NEW)\n- stick-rumble-server/internal/network/global_handler_test.go (NEW)\n\n**Test Results**:\n✅ All tests pass (make test-server)\n✅ No flakiness (-count=3 runs pass)\n✅ Schema loading happens once per test run (verified in logs)\n✅ go vet: PASS\n✅ gofmt: PASS  \n✅ Coverage: 88.3% (new code 100%)\n\n**Additional Discovery**:\nFound separate race condition in channel closing (line 265) unrelated to schema loading.

This slows down development feedback loops and CI pipelines.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nTests use `time.Sleep` with actual game timing constants instead of mocked/injectable time:\n\n### Major time sinks identified:\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:216`: `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` - health regen delay\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:296`: `time.Sleep(5500 * time.Millisecond)` - health regen after respawn  \n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:277`: `time.Sleep(3500 * time.Millisecond)` - respawn timing\n- `player_test.go:873`: `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)` - respawn delay\n- `gameserver_shooting_test.go`: Two 1700ms sleeps for reload cooldowns\n- 50+ smaller sleeps (50-100ms each) for async operations\n\n### Slow test breakdown:\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegenerationAfterRespawn`: 9.00s\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegeneration`: 6.10s\n- `TestGameServerRespawn_WeaponStateReset`: 3.10s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback_NoCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerPhysicsIntegration`: 1.00s\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n1. **Inject a clock interface** - Create a `Clock` interface with `Now()` and `Sleep()` methods. Use real clock in production, fake clock in tests that can be advanced instantly.\n\n2. **Use test-specific timing constants** - Allow tests to override `RespawnDelay`, `HealthRegenDelay`, `ReloadTime` etc. with shorter values.\n\n3. **Replace sleeps with event channels** - Instead of sleeping arbitrary durations, wait for specific events/conditions to occur.\n\n4. **Tag slow tests for optional exclusion** - Use `//go:build slow` build tags so developers can skip slow tests during rapid iteration.\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nReduce server test runtime from ~33s to \u003c5s while maintaining test coverage and reliability.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/game/gameserver.go` - Add clock injection\n- `internal/game/player.go` - Add clock injection for respawn/regen timing\n- `internal/game/weapon.go` - Add clock injection for reload timing\n- All test files using `time.Sleep`","notes":"Pull Request: https://github.com/mtomcal/stick-rumble/pull/10","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:58:09.556838989Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","close_reason":"PR #10 merged.

{"id":"stick-rumble-q26","title":"Part 1: Enhanced Phaser Mocks and Scene Lifecycle Unit Tests","description":"## Summary\nAgents are shipping code that passes 90%+ test coverage but fails in the actual browser. Human playtesting is catching bugs that automated tests should catch. This is a critical infrastructure issue blocking reliable AI-assisted development.\n\n## Bugs That Slipped Through Current Tests\n1. **stick-rumble-at3**: Player sprite duplication - PR #39 claimed to fix but still broken\n2. **stick-rumble-o5y**: Melee swing animations not rendering - PR #40 claimed to add but not working\n3. **stick-rumble-ela**: Original duplication bug incorrectly marked as fixed\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Current Test Infrastructure\n| Test Type | Framework | Coverage | Catches Rendering Bugs? |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Unit Tests | Vitest | 90%+ statements | ❌ No - mocks too simple |\n| Integration Tests | Vitest + real server | WebSocket flows | ❌ No - no rendering |\n| Visual Tests | Playwright | Only 2 UI components | ❌ No - no game entities |\n\n### Why Bugs Pass Tests But Fail in Browser\n\n#### 1. Player Duplication Bug (at3/ela)\nUnit tests never simulate scene restart lifecycle:\n```typescript\n// Unit test: Simple isolated scenario\nconst mockScene = createMockScene();\nconst manager = new PlayerManager(mockScene);\nmanager.updatePlayers(players);\n\n// Real browser: Complex lifecycle NOT TESTED\nGameScene.create() → PlayerManager created\nGameScene.update() → updatePlayers() called 20Hz\nmatch:ended event → cleanup needed\nscene.restart() → new GameScene.create() → new PlayerManager\\!\n// Unit test never simulates this restart + cleanup\n```\n\n#### 2. Melee Animation Bug (o5y/hcf)\nTests verify method calls but not actual rendering:\n```typescript\n// MeleeWeapon.test.ts - All tests pass but bug exists\nit('should render 90-degree swing arc for Bat', () =\u003e {\n  const graphics = scene.add.graphics();\n  weapon.showSwingAnimation(0);\n  expect(graphics.arc).toHaveBeenCalled();  // ✅ Passes - arc() was called\n  // ❌ NOT TESTED: Whether anything was actually drawn on screen\n});\n```\n\n### Critical Test Gaps\n\n| Gap | Impact |\n|-----|--------|\n| Phaser mock missing add.graphics(), sprite visibility tracking | Animations 'pass' but don't render |\n| No scene lifecycle tests | Restart bugs slip through |\n| Visual tests excluded from npm test | CI doesn't catch rendering regressions |\n| No game entity visual tests | Only health-bar and kill-feed tested |\n\n### Phaser Mock Analysis (tests/__mocks__/phaser.ts - 59 lines)\n\n**What's Mocked:**\n```typescript\nclass MockScene {\n  add = {\n    text: vi.fn(),    // Only 2 methods mocked\n    circle: vi.fn(),\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**What's MISSING:**\n- ❌ add.graphics() - No Graphics object mock (critical for MeleeWeapon)\n- ❌ add.rectangle() - Not in main Phaser mock\n- ❌ Sprite visibility, position, opacity, tint tracking\n- ❌ Game loop state tracking\n- ❌ Scene lifecycle hooks (create, update, shutdown)\n\n### Test Configuration Issue\n```typescript\n// vitest.config.ts\nexclude: [\n  '**/*.integration.test.ts',\n  '**/tests/visual/**',  // ← Visual tests excluded from main test run\\!\n],\n```\nImpact: `npm test` (main CI command) doesn't run visual regression tests.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Phase 1: Playwright Visual Tests for Game Entities\n- [ ] Add visual test for player sprites (verify no duplication after match restart)\n- [ ] Add visual test for melee swing animations (Bat brown arc visible, Katana silver arc visible)\n- [ ] Add visual test for scene cleanup (no zombie sprites after restart)\n- [ ] Create test harness HTML page for game entity testing (similar to /ui-test.html pattern)\n- [ ] Visual tests run in CI pipeline\n\n### Phase 2: Scene Lifecycle Unit Tests\n- [ ] Test PlayerManager destruction + recreation cycle\n- [ ] Test complete scene restart scenario (create → destroy → create)\n- [ ] Verify no zombie objects remain after cleanup\n- [ ] Test sprite count matches player count at all times\n- [ ] Test multiple consecutive match restarts\n\n### Phase 3: Enhanced Phaser Mocks\n- [ ] Add add.graphics() mock with state tracking (visible, destroyed, methods called)\n- [ ] Add add.rectangle() mock with position/visibility tracking\n- [ ] Add sprite creation/destruction counter\n- [ ] Track graphics visibility state throughout animation lifecycle\n- [ ] Add scene lifecycle simulation (create, update, shutdown hooks)\n\n### Phase 4: CI Integration\n- [ ] Visual tests included in CI pipeline (not excluded)\n- [ ] Test report shows rendering validation results\n- [ ] Failed visual tests block PR merge\n- [ ] Screenshot diffs attached to failed test reports\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Existing Visual Test Pattern (to extend)\n```typescript\n// tests/visual/health-bar.spec.ts - 105 lines\n// Uses custom page /ui-test.html with exposed global functions\nawait page.evaluate(() =\u003e {\n  (window as any).setHealthBarState(100, 100, false);\n});\nawait expect(page.locator('.health-bar')).toHaveScreenshot();\n```\n\n### Proposed Game Entity Test Harness\nCreate /ui-test-entities.html exposing:\n- window.spawnPlayer(id, x, y, color)\n- window.removePlayer(id)\n- window.getPlayerCount()\n- window.triggerMeleeSwing(weaponType, angle)\n- window.restartScene()\n- window.getActiveSprites()\n\n### Files to Modify/Create\n- stick-rumble-client/tests/__mocks__/phaser.ts -

The changes made were:\n- Changed from page.locator('canvas').toHaveScreenshot() to page.toHaveScreenshot()\n- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors related to 'clip' property\n\nASSERTION PATTERN REVIEW:\nThe tests use await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('filename.png', { clip: {...} })\n\nThis is the CORRECT pattern for Playwright visual regression testing. The assertion:\n1. Takes a screenshot of the specified region\n2. Compares it to a baseline image\n3. Fails if pixels differ beyond threshold\n\nKEY FINDING: These are NOT unit tests with traditional assertions like toBe() or toHaveBeenCalled(). They are visual regression tests where the assertion IS the screenshot comparison itself. This is the expected pattern.\n\nPOTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:\n1. Tests use page.waitForTimeout(100) - hardcoded waits are brittle\n2. No verification that window.setHealthBarState() or window.addKillFeedEntry() functions exist\n3.

This slows down development feedback loops and CI pipelines.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nTests use `time.Sleep` with actual game timing constants instead of mocked/injectable time:\n\n### Major time sinks identified:\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:216`: `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` - health regen delay\n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:296`: `time.Sleep(5500 * time.Millisecond)` - health regen after respawn  \n- `gameserver_tick_test.go:277`: `time.Sleep(3500 * time.Millisecond)` - respawn timing\n- `player_test.go:873`: `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)` - respawn delay\n- `gameserver_shooting_test.go`: Two 1700ms sleeps for reload cooldowns\n- 50+ smaller sleeps (50-100ms each) for async operations\n\n### Slow test breakdown:\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegenerationAfterRespawn`: 9.00s\n- `TestGameServerHealthRegeneration`: 6.10s\n- `TestGameServerRespawn_WeaponStateReset`: 3.10s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerReloadCompleteCallback_NoCallback`: 1.70s\n- `TestGameServerPhysicsIntegration`: 1.00s\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n1. **Inject a clock interface** - Create a `Clock` interface with `Now()` and `Sleep()` methods. Use real clock in production, fake clock in tests that can be advanced instantly.\n\n2. **Use test-specific timing constants** - Allow tests to override `RespawnDelay`, `HealthRegenDelay`, `ReloadTime` etc. with shorter values.\n\n3. **Replace sleeps with event channels** - Instead of sleeping arbitrary durations, wait for specific events/conditions to occur.\n\n4. **Tag slow tests for optional exclusion** - Use `//go:build slow` build tags so developers can skip slow tests during rapid iteration.\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nReduce server test runtime from ~33s to \u003c5s while maintaining test coverage and reliability.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/game/gameserver.go` - Add clock injection\n- `internal/game/player.go` - Add clock injection for respawn/regen timing\n- `internal/game/weapon.go` - Add clock injection for reload timing\n- All test files using `time.Sleep`","notes":"Pull Request: https://github.com/mtomcal/stick-rumble/pull/10","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:58:09.556838989Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:33:45.453111111Z","close_reason":"PR #10 merged.

{"id":"stick-rumble-wzq","title":"Fix weapon-configs.json missing projectile visuals and add config sync tests","description":"## Problem\nThe weapon-configs.json file is missing the `projectile` sub-object within `visuals` for each weapon. This causes all weapons to fall back to default yellow projectiles (0xffff00) instead of using the distinct colors/sizes defined in the hardcoded fallback.\n\n## Root Cause\nCommit 376700b (\"Add distinct firing patterns and visual character to automatic weapons\") only updated the hardcoded fallback in `getHardcodedWeaponConfigs()` but did NOT update `weapon-configs.json`. Since the JSON file loads successfully, the hardcoded fallback is never used, and all projectiles render identically.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- All weapons fire yellow projectiles with same size\n- Uzi, AK47, Pistol, Shotgun are visually indistinguishable\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Pistol: Yellow bullets (4px), yellow tracer (2px)\n- Uzi: Orange bullets (3px), orange tracer (1.5px) \n- AK47: Gold bullets (5px), gold tracer (2.5px)\n- Shotgun: Orange-red bullets (6px), orange-red tracer (3px)\n\n## Tasks\n\n### A) Fix the Bug\n1. Update `stick-rumble-client/public/weapon-configs.json` to include `projectile` object within `visuals` for each weapon\n2. Update `weapon-configs.json` at project root (if used)\n3. Verify visuals render correctly in-game\n\n### B) Add Testing to Prevent Recurrence\n\n#### Test 1: Config File vs Hardcoded Parity\nAdd integration test that verifies weapon-configs.json has the same structure as hardcoded fallback:\n- All fields present in hardcoded must exist in JSON\n- Fail if JSON is missing any nested properties\n\n#### Test 2: Schema Validation Test  \nAdd test that validates weapon-configs.json against WeaponConfig TypeScript interface:\n- Use TypeBox schema or manual validation\n- Run at test time to catch schema drift\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] weapon-configs.json includes projectile visuals for all ranged weapons\n- [ ] Uzi fires orange 3px projectiles (not yellow)\n- [ ] AK47 fires gold 5px projectiles (not yellow)\n- [ ] Integration test exists verifying JSON/hardcoded parity\n- [ ] Schema validation test exists for weapon-configs.json\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] \u003e90% coverage maintained","notes":"## Pattern Analysis\n\nThis bug shares a common pattern with several other open issues:\n\n### Pattern: Dual Source of Truth / Data Sync Issues\n- **wzq** (this issue): weapon-configs.json vs hardcoded fallback\n- **6s2**: Match.PlayerKills vs PlayerState.Kills  \n- **njr**: Client hardcoded fire rate vs server weapon config\n\nAll three have the same root cause: two places storing/tracking the same data that can get out of sync.\n\n### Pattern: Unit Tests Pass But Bug Exists\n- Tests verify individual components in isolation\n- No integration test verifies the actual data flow end-to-end\n- Bug only appears in real runtime when actual config file is loaded\n\n### Recommended Fix Approach\n1. Fix the immediate bug (update JSON file)\n2. Add parity test that fails if JSON differs from hardcoded\n3. Consider: Should we have ONE source of truth instead of two?\n\n### Related Issues\n- stick-rumble-6s2: Same dual-source pattern for kill tracking\n- stick-rumble-njr: Same pattern for fire rate config\n- stick-rumble-48z: Visual tests would catch render differences","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mandrew2008@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:06:19.548621-07:00","created_by":"Michael A Tomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-16T02:22:31.604328814Z","labels":["config","testing","visual-feedback","weapons"]}
