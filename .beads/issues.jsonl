{"id":"stick-rumble-350","title":"Tech Debt: Split epics.md into separate epic documents","description":"The current epics.md file is too large (~31K tokens) and overwhelms agent context windows when read.\n\n**Problem:**\n- docs/epics.md contains all epics (1-9+) in a single file\n- File exceeds 25K token read limit, requiring offset/limit pagination\n- Agents waste context loading irrelevant epic content\n- Difficult to maintain and update individual epics\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Split epics.md into individual epic files:\n   - docs/epics/epic-1-multiplayer-foundation.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-2-core-combat.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-3-weapon-systems.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-4-networked-gameplay.md\n   - (continue for epics 5-9)\n\n2. Create docs/epics/README.md or docs/epics/index.md:\n   - Overview of all epics with status\n   - Links to individual epic files\n   - Quick reference for epic dependencies\n\n3. Keep docs/epics.md as redirect/deprecated notice:\n   - Point to new location\n   - Or delete entirely after migration\n\n4. Update any references to epics.md in codebase:\n   - CLAUDE.md if applicable\n   - Any other documentation\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- Each epic file ~2-4K tokens (easily fits in context)\n- Agents can read only the relevant epic\n- Easier to update progress per-epic\n- Better git history (changes isolated to specific epics)\n\n**Technical Notes:**\n- Current file has 1198+ lines\n- Epic 3 alone spans lines 721-1152 (~430 lines)\n- Consider using consistent frontmatter (status, progress, dates)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:17:31.923411025Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T01:18:18.248249737Z"}
