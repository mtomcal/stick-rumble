Split epics.md into individual epic files:\n   - docs/epics/epic-1-multiplayer-foundation.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-2-core-combat.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-3-weapon-systems.md\n   - docs/epics/epic-4-networked-gameplay.md\n   - (continue for epics 5-9)\n\n2.

Use real clock in production, fake clock in tests that can be advanced instantly.\n\n2. **Use test-specific timing constants** - Allow tests to override `RespawnDelay`, `HealthRegenDelay`, `ReloadTime` etc. with shorter values.\n\n3. **Replace sleeps with event channels** - Instead of sleeping arbitrary durations, wait for specific events/conditions to occur.\n\n4. **Tag slow tests for optional exclusion** - Use `//go:build slow` build tags so developers can skip slow tests during rapid iteration.\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nReduce server test runtime from ~33s to \u003c5s while maintaining test coverage and reliability.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/game/gameserver.go` - Add clock injection\n- `internal/game/player.go` - Add clock injection for respawn/regen timing\n- `internal/game/weapon.go` - Add clock injection for reload timing\n- All test files using `time.Sleep`","notes":"Implementation note: Run with research phase enabled to understand existing time usage patterns across the codebase before implementing clock injection.\n\nCommand: /beads:full-cycle id=stick-rumble-mjw research=true","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:58:09.556838989Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T02:03:24.531337066Z","labels":["performance","tech-debt","testing"]}

Update Makefile test-server target (line 78):\n   - Remove -v flag from go test command\n   - Change from: cd stick-rumble-server \u0026\u0026 go test ./... -v\n   - Change to: cd stick-rumble-server \u0026\u0026 go test ./...\n\n2. Verify coverage script already optimal:\n   - scripts/check-coverage.sh:12 runs without -v (confirmed good)\n\n3. (Optional) Add verbose target for debugging:\n   - Add test-server-verbose target with -v flag for manual debugging\n\n**Expected Result:** ~85% reduction in server test output tokens (from ~30-50K to ~3-5K per run)\n\n**Technical Notes:**\n- Go tests silent by default (without -v), verbose on demand\n- Zero t.Log() calls in test files (good pattern)\n- 271 test functions across 28 test files\n- Makefile inconsistency: 'test' target quiet, 'test-server' verbose","notes":"Pull Request: https://github.com/mtomcal/stick-rumble/pull/6","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:15:51.487196318Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T01:36:10.521918364Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T01:34:53.481258235Z","close_reason":"Full cycle complete: Removed -v flag from test-server target, added test-server-verbose for debugging, updated CLAUDE.md documentation.

Define all server→client message schemas in TypeBox (12 types):\n   - room:joined {playerId}\n   - player:move {players: [{id, position, velocity, health, ...}]}\n   - projectile:spawn {id, ownerId, position, velocity}\n   - projectile:destroy {id}\n   - weapon:state {currentAmmo, maxAmmo, isReloading, canShoot}\n   - shoot:failed {reason}\n   - player:damaged {victimId, attackerId, damage, newHealth, projectileId}\n   - hit:confirmed {victimId, damage, projectileId}\n   - player:death {victimId, attackerId}\n   - player:kill_credit {killerId, victimId, killerKills, killerXP}\n   - player:respawn {playerId, position, health}\n   - match:timer {remainingSeconds}\n   - match:ended {winners, finalScores, reason}\n   - weapon:spawned {crates: [{id, position, weaponType, isAvailable}]}\n   - weapon:pickup_confirmed {playerId, crateId, weaponType, nextRespawnTime}\n   - weapon:respawned {crateId, weaponType, position}\n\n2. Add validation before server broadcast:\n   - Validate outgoing messages in broadcast_helper.go\n   - Development-only validation (skip in production for performance)\n\n3. Update client handlers to use typed data:\n   - GameSceneEventHandlers.ts uses generated types\n   - Remove manual type casting\n\n4. CI validation:\n   - Verify client and server schemas match\n   - Fail build on schema drift\n\n**Technical Notes:**\n- This completes the type-safe event system\n- Future weapon messages will follow this pattern\n- Enables Story 3.8 (Shared Config) to build on this infrastructure","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:37:17.104900845Z","created_by":"mtomcal","updated_at":"2026-01-12T01:37:17.104900845Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"stick-rumble-ys4","depends_on_id":"stick-rumble-iqu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T01:37:24.314781142Z","created_by":"mtomcal"}]}
