study IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the next unchecked spec from the validation checklist. read the spec, then read the actual source code it documents. verify the spec accurately reflects reality. if you find drift, note it in the plan's Findings section but do NOT edit the spec. one spec per iteration, then stop.

IMPORTANT:

check the course corrections section FIRST every iteration — follow any active corrections before doing anything else.
do NOT edit any spec files or source code — this is a read-only validation pass.
update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md progress checklist when a spec is validated.
update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Findings table if you find remaining drift.
do exactly ONE checklist item per iteration, then stop.
output `/done` when all specs are validated.
