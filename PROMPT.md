Each iteration, pick the next unchecked spec from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and verify it against the archived source code in docs/archive/20251125-055521-pre-bmm/. Read the spec, read the source file(s) it documents, and fix any inaccuracies in the spec so it truthfully describes what the code does.

IMPORTANT:

check the course corrections section FIRST every iteration — follow any active corrections before doing anything else.
you may ONLY edit files inside docs/archive/20251125-055521-pre-bmm/specs/ — never touch source code files.
do NOT edit PROMPT.md.
update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md when you finish each item (check it off) and when you discover something the plan missed (add to Discoveries table).
commit your work at the end of every iteration with a message like "docs: verify {spec-name} against archived source".
output `/done` when all checklist items are checked off.
